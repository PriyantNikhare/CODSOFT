## Introduction

This repository serves as a record of my internship experience at **Codsoft**, where I worked on enhancing my Java programming skills. The projects cover various key concepts like object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures, algorithms, and more. The repository demonstrates my ability to write clean, efficient, and maintainable Java code.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language
- **Eclipse/IntelliJ IDEA**: IDE for Java development
- **Maven/Gradle**: Build automation tools (if applicable)
- **Git**: Version control system

## Projects

1. **Number Game**

   **Description:**  
      This project is a command-line game built in Java. In this game, the user has to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback whether the user's guess is too high, too low, or correct. It limits the number of attempts for each round and offers the option to play multiple rounds. A score is maintained based on the rounds played.

   **Topics covered:**  
    - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
    - Random number generation
    - User input handling
    - Loops and conditionals
    - Score and attempt tracking
