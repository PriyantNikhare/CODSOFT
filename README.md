## Introduction

This repository serves as a record of my internship experience at **Codsoft**, where I worked on enhancing my Java programming skills. The projects cover various key concepts like object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures, algorithms, and more. The repository demonstrates my ability to write clean, efficient, and maintainable Java code.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language
- **Eclipse/IntelliJ IDEA**: IDE for Java development
- **Maven/Gradle**: Build automation tools (if applicable)
- **Git**: Version control system

## Projects

1. **Project Name 1: Number Game**

   **Description:**  
      This project is a command-line game built in Java. In this game, the user has to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback whether the user's guess is too high, too low, or correct. It limits the number of attempts for each round and offers the option to play multiple rounds. A score is maintained based on the rounds played.

   **Topics covered:**  
    - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
    - Random number generation
    - User input handling
    - Loops and conditionals
    - Score and attempt tracking

3. **Project Name 2: Student Grade Calculator**
   - Description: A console-based application that takes the marks obtained by students in various subjects, calculates the total marks and average percentage, and assigns grades based on the average percentage achieved. The application provides a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.
   - Topics covered: Algorithms, file handling, data structures, user input validation.

4. **Project Name 3: ATM Interface**
   - Description: A simulation of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) that allows users to perform basic banking transactions such as withdrawing cash, depositing funds, and checking account balances. The application ensures safe transactions through validation checks.
   - Topics covered: Concurrency, exception handling, object-oriented programming, user interface design.

4. **Project Name 4: Currency Converter**
   - Description: The **Currency Converter** is a Java application that allows users to convert amounts between different currencies using real-time exchange rates. Users can select a base currency and a target currency, input an amount, and the application will calculate the equivalent amount in the target currency.
   - Topics covered: API Integration (fetching real-time currency rates), Input Validation, Basic arithmetic operations, User Interface Design (console-based or GUI).

5. **Project Name 5: Student Management System**
   - Description: The **Student Management System** is a Java application that manages student records. It allows users to add, remove, search, and display student details such as name, roll number, and grade. The system is designed to ensure data integrity and provide a user-friendly interface.
   - Topics covered: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), File Handling (reading/writing student data), Input Validation, Console-based or GUI Application Development.

## Installation and Setup

To run any of the projects on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PriyantNikhare/CODSOFT.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Tasks
   ```

3. Import the project into your favorite Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).

4. Compile and run the code using the IDE or a command-line tool.

## Usage

- Each project is self-contained and has its own README file, explaining how to compile and execute the code.
- Explore different Java concepts and projects by browsing the source code files in each directory.
